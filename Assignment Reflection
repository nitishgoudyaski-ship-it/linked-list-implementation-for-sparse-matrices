How long did you spend on this assignment?  
I spent about 3 hours working on this assignment, including reading about sparse matrix linked list representations, writing the code, and debugging my implementation.  

Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?  
I would give myself an A, because I studied the topic carefully, implemented the linked list, and tested the code on multiple cases.  

Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?  
I believe I earned an A, since the program compiles successfully, runs without errors, and displays both the triplet form and full matrix form of the sparse matrix.  

Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.  
My solution correctly stores and displays sparse matrices using a linked list. 
However, one limitation is that the linked list traversal for displaying the full matrix is O(m√ón), which can be inefficient for very large matrices. 
Another issue is that elements are inserted at the end of the list without sorting, so the output assumes that elements are added in row-major order. 
I initially struggled with keeping the linked list traversal aligned with the full matrix display, but I solved this by carefully checking row and column indices during display.
