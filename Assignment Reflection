How many hours do you think you spent on this assignment?
I have worked around 3 hours goes into completing this assignment through reading, coding, and debugging your code on representations involving sparse matrix linked lists.

Using the effort you put in, which grade letter do you think you earned?
I would give myself an A, as I studied the topic well, applied the linked list, and ran the program on multiple examples.

According to your response, what letter grade would you assign yourself?
I believe that I received an A, as the program compiles successfully, runs without any issues, and prints out the triplet form and full matrix form of the sparse matrix.

Write a summary of what goes wrong in your solution, and an explanation of how you attempted to fix the problem and where you suspect you got stuck.
My solution correctly stores and displays sparse matrices using a linked list.
One downside, however, is that the linked list traversal to print out the full matrix is O(m√ón), which is less than desirable for large matrices.
Another issue is that the elements are appended to the end of the list and not sorted, so the output anticipates elements to be inserted in row-major order.
I initially struggled with maintaining synchronization between traversing the linked list and showing the whole matrix, but I solved this by redouble-checking row and column indices while showing.
